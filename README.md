This is a single-page web application that uses the Github Gist API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/gists) to show different information about a user's Gists or the components of a Gist.

Basically you can enter in the search bar a Github username and if that user has any Gists made public, it will show them below. Also it will show all the languages that you can find in that Gist as well as the forks and who forked it by pressing the "See forks" button which will appear in the right of each Pane. I chose to put the gists in different panes because it looks a little bit cleaner and you can distinguish all the info for each one.

Each pane will show the Title/Description of the Gist, how many files there are, which languages are found there and also the files from which you can click to see its content.
